# 4-Bit Binary Adder (Verilog HDL)

## 📘 Overview
This project implements a **4-bit binary adder** using Verilog HDL. The adder takes two 4-bit binary inputs and produces a 4-bit sum and a carry-out bit. It demonstrates fundamental digital design concepts, including combinational logic and dataflow modeling.

## ⚙️ Features
- Adds two 4-bit binary numbers
- Generates a carry-out bit when overflow occurs
- Uses concise **dataflow modeling** in Verilog
- Verified with a **SystemVerilog testbench**
- Simulated successfully on [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/)

## 🧩 Files Included
- `design.sv` — Main Verilog module implementing the 4-bit adder  
- `testbench.sv` — SystemVerilog testbench for testing the adder

## 🧠 Simulation Output
Example simulation results:
A B SUM CARRY
0001 0010 0011 0
0101 0011 1000 0
1111 0001 0000 1

## 💻 Tools Used
- **Language:** Verilog / SystemVerilog  
- **Simulator:** Icarus Verilog on EDA Playground  
- **Environment:** Web-based HDL simulation and debugging
